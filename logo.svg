DOCUMENTATION:

When you use the commented svg code examples, make sure to comment out the default ones.

box var set to: box = 240

A rectangle by the relation width = 2 height = 1 is used for calculations of paths.

In this case: height = box = 240, width = box * 2 = 480.

To make the square version the height is later also set to (box * 2).

The mask stroke is set to: (box * 2) / 10.

The zoomed out version just increases outside width and height to 4 * box (in this case 960x960), useful for wallpapers and art.

-->

<!-- Remove rectangle for transparency, change rectangle size when you change outside dimensions, if you need a fill background. Optionally set rounded corners for small logo's (e.g. favicon). Set rounded radius in that case to mask-stroke * 2 (96 in this case). In case of a small icon a brighter version of the background works better.-->



<!-- Default dark color background version, color is based on default color, with a gradient 0.7 color reduction -->
